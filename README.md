Division 2 Night Time Checker.

People can use this to determine when night time will be based on when they want to play.

Basically its helpful for those of us who need to get the hunters as most of the time its at night...

THis is based on the work from this reddit:
https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/o0a3x0/the_craziness_that_is_division_2s_ingame_hours/ and the spreadsheet contained within.

7am and 9pm seem to be relatively set in stone, with a small margin of error so it is fairly reasonable to make some assumptions about when they will clock over and thus you can figure out when it will be 9pm based on any given time and date.

It still needs a bit of work,, I want to give some more insight to what time it is roughly so players can have a better idea of whether its worth chasing hunters at that point in time.
